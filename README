Home away from home

The contents of this repository allow for setting up an interactive shell just
the way I like it. The workflow is more of a scratch pad, so count on history
to be rewritten arbitrarily.

Run ./setup.sh to install files to your $HOME. Any files that already exist
will be preserved as *.orig
